Introduction
============

Welcome to the Kokkos version of the Vector Particle-in-Cell code, VPIC 2.0!  VPIC is a 3D3V, fully relativistic, kinetic, performance-first PIC code for solving the coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann system of equations.

Getting Started
***************
Getting started with VPIC will be much easier when the documentation is complete!  For now, read the README, hope there is a file in vpik-kokkos/arch that you can work from, and ask someone for a deck they use.
