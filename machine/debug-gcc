/* Debugging install - assumes generic MPI and gcc style compiler flags.
   Uses portable V4 library and no restricted pointer optimizations.

   To learn how to configure which compilers are used by mpicc and mpiCC on
   your platform, check the man pages ("man mpicc" and "man mpiCC"). Usually,
   you can set these through environment variables. For example:
     LAMHCC, LAMHCP for LAM-MPI 
     MPICH_CC, MPICH_CLINKER, MPI_CCC, MPICH_CCLINKER for MPICH */
