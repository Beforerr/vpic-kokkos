/* This has been tested on a patched gcc-3.3.3 and LAM-7.0.4 MPI library. It
   assumes LAM's mpicc and mpiCC have been configured to use a patched
   gcc-3.3.3 as the default compiler (set the environment variables LAMHCC
   and LAMHCP accordingly).
   
   Earlier versions of LAM will probably work okay (such as 6.5.6). Earlier
   versions of gcc are known NOT to work (v4_sse.hxx requires patched gcc-3.3
   or higher). If V4 acceleration or v4_portable.hxx is used, earlier gcc
   versions should work.  gcc-4.1.x works without patching but has flaky
   aliasing analysis (use -fno-strict-aliasing).*/
