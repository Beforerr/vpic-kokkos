/* Generic machine description - assumes generic MPI and generic compiler
   flags. No V4 hardware acceleration or restricted pointer optimizations.

   To learn how to configure which compilers are used by mpicc and mpiCC on
   your platform, check the man pages ("man mpicc" and "man mpiCC"). Usually,
   you can set these through environment variables. For example:
     LAMHCC, LAMHCP for LAM-MPI 
     MPICH_CC, MPICH_CLINKER, MPI_CCC, MPICH_CCLINKER for MPICH
