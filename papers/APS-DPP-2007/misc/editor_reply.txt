> Please make the following changes in your revised paper.
>
> 1. Please use the standard acronym 3D, rather than 3d-the small d

Done.

> 2. Use Roman numerals to label section headings and to refer to such

>
>  I. INTRODUCTION
>
>  . . . in Sec. IV
>
> Sub-headings are then alternately lettered and numbered, as:
>
>  A. Second-level headings
>  1. Third-level headings

Done.

> 3. When referring to a reference as part of a sentence, do not use
> just the reference number, but a phrase such as:
> 
>  ". . . as given in Ref. 2" or " (see, for example, Ref. 23)"

Done.

> 4. Please follow the table format as shown below, particularly
> noting the where the double and single horizontal lines should
> go. No vertical lines are to be used.
>
>  Table II. Caption text should be placed above the table itself and
>  separated from the body of the text by a double line.
>
>  Column headings should be spaced appropriately_and underlined with a
>  single line.
>
>  Rows of data should also be spaced appropriately, not separated by
>  lines.
>
>  The end of the table should be noted with a final double line.

Done.

> 5. Please check that you capitalize Raman whenever it appears (see
> the caption for Figure 2).

Done (that was the only one mistyped).

The BibTeX style settings were inadvertently disregarded in generating
the original submission.  As such, a great deal of detail was lost in
the citations.  The revised submission correctly applies the BibTeX
style settings; this hopefully will correct many of the issues below.
Also, the actual BibTeX citations themselves are far more detailed and
has been attached to this email for your convenience if any relevant
details are still missing.

Former Ref. 11 had detail spuriously omitted.  This frequently cited
(including, to the best of our knowledge, at least one other article
already accepted for publication in this special issue) gives the
algorithm used as the basis for the majority of modern relativistic
electromagnetic particle integration methods.  With the additional
detail, we believe this citation should be acceptable to the editors.
Further citation details are provided below in BibTeX form:

@InProceedings{Boris_1970,
  author =    {J.~P.~Boris},
  title =     {Relativistic Plasma Simulation---Optimization of a Hybrid Code},
  booktitle = {Proc.~4th Conf.~on Num.~Sim.~of Plasmas},
  pages =     {3-67},
  year =      {1970},
  editor =    {J.~P.~Boris and R.~A.~Shanny},
  address =   {Washington D.~C.},
  month =     {2-3 November},
  publisher = {Naval Research Laboratory}
}

Former Ref. 15 had detail spuriously omitted.  This article is in a
publication of ACM (``SC'06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE
Conference on Supercomputing'' ISBN 0-7695-2700-0), covering articles
submitted to the premier annual international conference on high
performance computation.  A hard copy of this book can be obtained
easily.  Articles in this book are multiply peer reviewed, and, this
particular article won the competitive best paper award at this
conference.  Given this and the professional standing of ACM and IEEE,
the editor's concern about legitimacy should be satisfied (we have
never had an issue with citing this work in other journals).
Hopefully, with the additional detail restored, the editors will find
this citation acceptable.  Further citation details are provided below
in BibTeX form:

@InProceedings{Bowers_et_al_2006,
  author =    {K.~J.~Bowers and E.~Chow and H.~Xu and R.~O.~Dror and M.~P.~Eastwood and B.~A.~Gregersen and J.~L.~Klepeis and I.~Kolossvary and M.~A.~Moraes and F.~D.~Sacerdoti and J.~K.~Salmon and Y.~Shan and D.~E.~Shaw},

Former ref. 17 has been removed from the paper as it is not critical
to subject (it was an example of the use of single precision for
rigorous matrix compuations).  While this is an easily obtainable
report and we believe that awareness of such methods would be
beneficial to the plasma physics community, we do not believe that
this citation can be put into a form acceptable to the editors.

Former ref. 20 has been removed from the paper.  We are not aware of
any citations that the editors would find acceptable here.  Namely,
outside of conference papers, lab technical reports, budget requests
and so forth, there are a large number of press releases (from IBM and
Los Alamos), newspaper and magazine articles about Roadrunner.
However, we do not see how we can properly cite any of this given the
constraints above.

> 8. Ref. 21: The titles of papers "submitted to" or "to be published
> in" must be included in the citation.

Done.  Also, former ref. 23 has since been published and updated
accordingly.

> 9. Please upload the source files for the revised paper. The
> acceptable formats for the text are Word, Latex and Revtex. The
> acceptable formats for the figures are postscript, eps and tiff.

Will do shortly.

> We also need the copyright form for the paper. You can upload a pdf
> file of the form with the files for your revised paper, or you may

Will do shortly.
