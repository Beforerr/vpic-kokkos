\note{Place holder abstract.  If we keep any of this we might not want to mention Livermore ;-)}
In this paper, we demonstrate the unprecedented performance and scalability of VPIC, a three-dimensional, relativistic, kinectic plasma simulation code on the heterogeneous, IBM RoadRunner supercomputer at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Simulations of Laser-Plasma Interactions (LPI) with up to one trillion particles, which achieve a sustained performance of ~0.4 Pflop/s, are detailed.  This work will enable significant breakthroughs in our understanding of plasma reflectivity in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) at the National Ignition Facility (NIF), located in Livermore, California.

The RoadRunner supercopmuter, shown in figure \ref{fig:system}, is a hybrid, petascale system to be deployed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2008.  The system is a first-of-its-kind, heterogeneous cluster that utilizes a combination of 6,912 1.8 GHz, dual-socket, dual-core AMD Opteron \emph{host} processors with 12,960 3.2 GHz, IBM Cell \emph{extended Double-Precision (eDP)} \emph{accelerator} processors.  Each Cell eDP chip is capable of performing 102.4 Gflop/s \textbf{double-precision}, for a total theoretical peak performance of ~1.3 Pflop/s.  The RoadRunner supercomputer will be the first machine to acheive a sustained petaflop on the LINPACK benchmarks used in ranking the fastest computers in the world for the TOP500 list.\note{add TOP500 citation}

Using a top-down description, the planned system will be comprised of 18 \emph{Connected Units (CUs)}, using eight, second-stage, 288-port Voltaire Ifiniband $4x$ DDR switches.  This allows for twelve links per CU to each of the eight switches.  Each CU will be made up of 180 \emph{Triblade}, compute nodes and 12 I/O nodes connected by a first-stage, 288-port Voltaire Infiniband $4x$ DDR switch.  This configuration allows for 192 ports \emph{in} and 96 ports \emph{up}, creating a 2-to-1 over-subscribed, fat-tree network topology.

A Triblade compute node, figure \ref{fig:triblade}, actually integrates four physical blades: one IBM LS21, dual-socket Opteron blade, one expansion blade, and two IBM QS22 Cell blades containing the new eDP chips.  The expansion blade connects the two QS22s to the LS21 via four PIC-e $x8$ links and provides the node's ConnectX IB $4x$ DDR link to the rest of the CU cluster.
