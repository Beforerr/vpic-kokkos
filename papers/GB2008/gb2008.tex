\note{Place holder abstract.  If we keep any of this we might not want to mention Livermore ;-)}
In this paper, we demonstrate the unprecedented performance and scalability of VPIC, a three-dimensional, relativistic, kinectic plasma simulation code on the heterogeneous, IBM RoadRunner supercomputer at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Simulations of Laser-Plasma Interactions (LPI) with up to one trillion particles, which achieve a sustained performance of ~0.4 Pflop/s, are detailed.  This work will enable significant breakthroughs in our understanding of plasma reflectivity in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) at the National Ignition Facility (NIF), located in Livermore, California.
